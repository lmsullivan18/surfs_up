# Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to dive deeper into the temperature trends in Oahu, to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

# Results
- Average temperatures are higher in June, and lower in December.
- In general, the temperatures are not drastically different between the two months. The means differ by about 4 degrees. The maximum temperatures only differ by two degrees!
- The minimum temperature between months is where we see the most difference. The minimum temperature in December is 56 degrees, and the minimum in June is 64 – an eight-degree difference.

# Summary

Overall, temperatures appear to be pretty consistent in Oahu. While they do dip a bit in December, the average temperature is still in the 70s – perfect ice cream weather if you ask me!

Two additional queries I would perform to gather more weather data for June and December include looking into the amount of precipitation by month and the weather data from the station closest to the location of the potential store. Even when its warm, people are less likely to be surfing and out for ice cream when it is raining. And weather could vary across the island based on proximity to the coast, elevation, etc. so it could be useful to do a deeper dive into just the weather near the shop.
